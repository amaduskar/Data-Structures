Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.  
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).  
In the min-max stack, we use lists and OOP to develop a stack which supports the following operations -  
* Push - Add an element to the stack  
* Pop - Return the top most element of the stack and remove it  
* Peek - Return the top most element of the stack without removing it  
* getMin - Return the smallest element of the stack  
* getMax - Return the largest element of the stack  
All of these operations are done in constant time and space i.e. O(1)
